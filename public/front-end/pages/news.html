				<h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center">18 Books that I Listened to In 2017</h1>

			<div class="news-page__row__content__body">
				<p>I have found no better source to improve myself other than listening to books, and as I have done in the previous years, I will go through introducing the books I have read this year.</p>
				<p>This year I have been experimenting with “neuroplasticity’, the fact that our brains can rewire the neurons and allocate more neurons to a certain task.
				</p>

				<p>I have been gradually increasing the speed by which I listen to and comprehend an audio book, and now I am comfortable with 2.5x speed, which has helped me listen to even more books.
				</p>
				<p>Like many previous years, the books I have read are non-fiction and are about my favorite topics. Biographies, Productivity, Entrepreneurship, Neurosciences, and Finance.
				</p>

				<p>So without further due, here is the list:
				</p>
				<img src="./assets/images/book.jpeg" class="img-fluid h-100 d-flex mx-auto pb-2" alt="">
				<h3>1- Shoe Dog (Phil Knight): A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</h3>

				<p>It is very well written, and makes you imagine the scenes and feelings. Takeaway for me: The early days of even the best brands have been though. Extremely though. They have gone nearly bankrupt many times and the founders have felt they are not going anywhere, but eventually perseverance paid off.</p>

				<h3>2-Whiplash (Joi Ito): How to Survive our Faster Future</h3>

				<p>Great read from a personal idol, Joi Ito (Director of MIT’s Media Lab) to see what the future may look like</p>

				<h3>3- Sprint (Jake Knapp): How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in 5 Days</h3>

				<p>I had read the summary of this book before but this time I read the full text. This is one of the methods Google uses for brainstorming new ideas.</p>

				<h3>4- Rework (Jason Fried)</h3>

				<p>A new and fresh way to look into how businesses should be run.</p>

				<h3>5- Hooked (Nir Eyal): How to Build Habit-Forming Products</h3>

				<p>Nir Eyal is a genius of habits and understanding how humans form habits.</p>

				<h3>6- Start With Why (Simon Sinek): How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action</h3>

				<p>Second time I read this book. Although I don’t agree with all of Simon Sinek’s ideology, Starting with Why has stopped me from jumping in a number of opportunities this year!</p>

				<p>Happy 2018!</p>
